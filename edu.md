# Education
**GOAL**: Provide innovative frontier physics education and training
for undergraduate STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors, graduate students,
postdocs, and early career faculty as well as develop a diverse workforce in physics and engineering.

To accomplish the education goal above, PIRE-GEMADARC will meet the following
educational objectives: 
1. International experiences and workforce development: provide 174 students with international experiences and workforce development training to increase the number, quality and diversity of students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, who pursue careers in frontier science.

2. Leadership, collaboration, and communication skills: improve students' leadership, international
collaboration, and communication skills to be able to relate scientific knowledge to the broader
community, develop international collaborations and cultivate interactions between students and faculty
of different academic departments.

3. Collaboration capacity: strengthen collaboration ability to foster new scientists and young leaders in Ge detectors and technology resulting in new applications.
