## To contents editors

The contents are written in markdown format as described here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/. One can directly edit any file ended with **.md** using the github UI.

## To site administrators

The contents written in markdown format are converted to HTML format by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The layouts of web pages are defined in files in the \_layouts/ directory, which combine files in the \_includes/ directory and those **.md** files.
