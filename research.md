### Vison, Goal and Objectives

**VISON**: Our vision is to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level.
Driving innovative R&D for ton-scale Ge detectors holds the best discovery potential for community
demands for new technologies to discover DM and 0νββ decay as well as to observe coherent
elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS). New knowledge and the development of novel materials
and detectors will not only enable the education and training of a new generation of scientists capable of
exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, but also support the discovery of yet-unprobed
neutrino properties, like neutrino magnetic moments and milli-charge.

The **GOAL** of the PIRE-GEMADARC are:
- **New Knowledge.** Advance knowledge, research and discovery in fundamental physics by developing
novel materials and detectors to improve the sensitivity of ton-scale DM and neutrino experiments.

- **Advanced Education and Training.** Provide innovative frontier physics education and training
for undergraduate STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors, graduate students,
postdocs, and early career faculty as well as develop a diverse workforce in physics and engineering.

- **Global Research Partnership.** Improve collaboration on Ge-related R&D activities through integrative
global partnership, anchored by best-in-class research facilities, resources, and expertise.
