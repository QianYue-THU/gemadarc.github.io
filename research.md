### Vison, Goal and Objectives

**VISON**: Our vision is to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level.
Driving innovative R&D for ton-scale Ge detectors holds the best discovery potential for community
demands for new technologies to discover DM and 0νββ decay as well as to observe coherent
elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS). New knowledge and the development of novel materials
and detectors will not only enable the education and training of a new generation of scientists capable of
exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, but also support the discovery of yet-unprobed
neutrino properties, like neutrino magnetic moments and milli-charge.

The **GOAL** of the PIRE-GEMADARC are:
- **New Knowledge.** Advance knowledge, research and discovery in fundamental physics by developing
novel materials and detectors to improve the sensitivity of ton-scale DM and neutrino experiments.

- **Advanced Education and Training.** Provide innovative frontier physics education and training
for undergraduate STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors, graduate students,
postdocs, and early career faculty as well as develop a diverse workforce in physics and engineering.

- **Global Research Partnership.** Improve collaboration on Ge-related R&D activities through integrative
global partnership, anchored by best-in-class research facilities, resources, and expertise.

**OBJECTIVES**: We will conduct several critical R&D activities and create new capacities to: **(1)** advance
research techniques in zone refinement and crystal growth to guarantee the purity and appropriate gradient
of large-size (up to ~10 cm in diameter and ~10 cm in length) Ge (LGe) detector-grade crystals; **(2)**
develop novel LGe detectors, using self-grown crystals, to achieve low energy threshold (< 100 eV) for
DM and CEvNS detection and electron/gamma (e/γ) discrimination for 0νββ decay; **(3)** improve detector
performance through better understanding of charge collection efficiency, background reduction, and systematic
uncertainties; and **(4)** accelerate education and training for young scientists in the field.

### Proposed Research and Methods
PIRE-GEMADARC intends to advance Ge materials for developing novel detectors fabricated from well characterized
crystals and well-tested contact technology to improve understanding of detector performance.

The proposed research includes three distinct tasks: 
- Material advancement for developing novel Ge detectors.
  - Zone Refinement
  - Crystal Growth
  - Crystal Characterization
- Development of novel Ge detectors. 
  - Planar detector with internal amplification, a high risk and high impact R&D.
  - SuperCDMS-type detectors.
  - Inverted coaxial PPC detectors for ton-scale 0νββ decay.
- Improvement of detector performance.
  - Development of test methodology.
  - Development of a special Ge detector simulation toolkit.
  - Development of models to study pulse shape discrimination (PSD).

### Anticipated Timelines, Milestones, and Deliverables
The Table below shows the timelines, milestones and deliverables. The developed test methods, simulation
codes, and models will be published in high-profile journals as well as shared at national conferences. The
500 samples for characterization will be cut from zone-refined ingots and grown crystals. The significant deliverables include LGe detectors (6 detectors), fabricated/validated using self-grown crystals, with low-energy threshold (< 100 eV) for DM
detection and with optimization of e/γ discrimination for 0νββ decay.

### Broader Impacts and Expected Significance
PIRE-GEMARDARC will lead to improved sensitivity for DM detection and neutrino experiments. The
field of DM and 0νββ decay research is highly developed with 30+ years of research and vigorous programs
nationally and internationally. In the U.S., the premier experiments are liquid Xenon (e.g. XENON100
[86], LUX/LZ and Ge (e.g. SuperCDMS) for DM, and MAJORANA, CUORE, and
EXO for 0νββ decay. We intend to add to the current base of research by resolving two challenges:

- Developing techniques to guarantee the cleanliness and purity of detector materials for new Ge detectors
- Advancing large-size detectors with extremely low energy threshold for DM and extremely
low background with e/γ discrimination for 0νββ decay. 

In particular, we will deliver self-grown crystals, with well-characterized properties, for consistently producing detectors with internal amplification, SuperCDMS-type detectors, and inverted coaxial PPC detectors. This work, in addition to advancing
cosmic and neutrino research, also will enable new types of low threshold, high-resolution Ge detectors
to be innovated for academic research, scientific projects and various applications in homeland security,
environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. Moreover, our Consortium will recruit and educate a
diverse cadre of young scientists who will lead future development of physics beyond the Standard Model.
By Year 5, our robust and integrated research and education-training program will have equipped 174
undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers alongside of at least 5 postdocs and early career
investigators with the technical, professional, and global entrepreneurial skill sets required to lead the next
generation of physics workforce. A primary emphasis is placed on training Native American and female
students: Nearly 30% of students trained by the Consortium will be from underrepresented groups. Significantly,
our novel program creates a global "Community of Practice" comprised of: (1) coordinated
pedagogical planning to advance students' critical structural thinking; (2) an integrated graduate curriculum
and advising program; (3) international study that provides content, tools, and collaborative spaces
for enriched learning; (4) joint advising, mentoring and other professional development opportunities; and
(5) exchange programs (supported by detailed logistical, language and cultural protocols) with leading
institutions in the U.S., Canada, China, and Germany. Project-based courses, research experiences, foreign
language instruction coupled with international advisement will equip students with strong disciplinary expertise
in collaborative research and develop students who are well-prepared prepared to work with all stakeholders in
global technology development. In addition, 6 early-career faculty members participate in PIREGEMADARC
and its comprehensive, internationally based Junior Faculty Development Program.
