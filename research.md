### Vison, Goal and Objectives

**VISON**: Our vision is to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level.
Driving innovative R&D for ton-scale Ge detectors holds the best discovery potential for community
demands for new technologies to discover DM and 0νββ decay as well as to observe coherent
elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS). New knowledge and the development of novel materials
and detectors will not only enable the education and training of a new generation of scientists capable of
exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, but also support the discovery of yet-unprobed
neutrino properties, like neutrino magnetic moments and milli-charge.
